# csci5523-Clustering-and-Webpage-Mining
This project deals with *.sgm webpage files. The purpose is to use kmeans to cluster objects corresponding to sparse high dimensional vectors. The project consists of the following multiple components:

+ Getting the dataset, data cleaning
+ Preprocessing the dataset to get bag of word vector representation
+ Using k-means to clustering the dataset based on different objective function
+ Evaluating the quality based on entropy and purity.

preprocess.py deals with preprocessing  
kcluster.java is the k-clustering algorithm.

Each file is a highly integrated code. Checkout the project2.pdf to see the details of problem the code addresses.
