# csci5523-Frequent-Set-and-Association-Rule-Mining
This project deals with a dataset of grocery store transaction records. The purpose is to generate all frequent set and association rules whose support is greater than a user supplied minimum support and whose confidence is greater than a user supplied minimum confidence. The project consists of multiple components, including implementing database-projection based algorithm, FP-tree data structure and Apriori association rule algorithm. 

Each file is a highly integrated code. Checkout the project2.pdf to see the details of problem the code addresses.
